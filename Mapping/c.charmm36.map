;  Mapping file for cytosine RNA
;   - Adapted from Parisa-2014 CHARMM DNA mapping files to RNA; Helgi I. Ingolfsson <ingolfsson@gmail.com> 2015.11
;   - Changes to fix chirality of H1' and H4' in sugar backbone; Helgi I. Ingolfsson <ingolfsson@gmail.com> 2015.11
;   - Rules and atom definitions for the 3'/5'ends added, can be in the same file as those are skipped when not in the AA topology; Helgi I. Ingolfsson <ingolfsson@gmail.com> 2015.11
;   - Nucleobase mapping and rules changed was leaning too much in the SC3 direction; Helgi I. Ingolfsson <ingolfsson@gmail.com> 2015.11
